------------------------------------------------------------------------
What unauthorized sources of information did you use to complete the
assignment? List any unauthorized sources of information that you used
to complete the assignment, and describe how you used them. The course
"Policies" web page defines unauthorized sources of information, and
any source that you have used but not listed in the authorized sources
should be included here. Please note that using an unauthorized source
may trigger a course penalty, and depending on the nature of the
interaction, may additionally require the interaction being reported
to the Committee on Discipline. Write "None" if you used no
unauthorized sources of information.

None

What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful? Was it fun?

It was helpful, but I also felt like the specification was not as 
detailed as the first assignment (which I guess is normal)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?



------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate on stra.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and express your
disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then write
"None."

None

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on stra.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

   stra.c: line 115: low priority: 
   This area is deeply nested at level 4, consider refactoring

   stra.c: line 112: low priority: 
   This area is deeply nested at level 4, consider refactoring

In order to implement the Str_search module, it was necessary to 
create two nested for loops and use conditionals within the loops.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate on strp.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and express your
disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then write
"None."

None

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on strp.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

   strp.c: line 13: low priority: 
   Parameter name 'pcSrc' in function definition differs from parameter 
   name 'acSrc' in function declaration

   strp.c: line 25: low priority: 
   Parameter name 'pcDst' in function definition differs from parameter 
   name 'acDst' in function declaration

   strp.c: line 25: low priority: 
   Parameter name 'pcSrc' in function definition differs from parameter 
   name 'acSrc' in function declaration

   strp.c: line 46: low priority: 
   Parameter name 'pcDst' in function definition differs from parameter 
   name 'acDst' in function declaration

   strp.c: line 46: low priority: 
   Parameter name 'pcSrc' in function definition differs from parameter 
   name 'acSrc' in function declaration

Since the array and pointer notations are equivalent to the compiler, 
I chose to use the array parameter names from stra.c for the header, 
which generated these warnings when strp.c called the str.h header.

   strp.c: line 115: low priority: 
   This area is deeply nested at level 4, consider refactoring

In order to implement the Str_search module, it was necessary to 
create two nested for loops and use conditionals within the loops.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate on replace.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and express your
disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then write
"None."

None

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on replace.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

None

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Is it possible for Str_copy or Str_concat to call assert to verify
that the destination memory area specified by the caller is large
enough? Explain.

Yes. Since assert(expr) simply checks whether the contained expression
is true, we can set the expression to be 
sizeof(pcDst[])/sizeof(char) >= strlen(pcSrc) + 1 to check whether the
destination memory area is large enough.
